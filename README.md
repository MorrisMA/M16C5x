General Description
-------------------

This project demonstrates the use of a PIC16C5x-compatible core as an FPGA-
based processor. The core provided is instruction set compatible, but it is 
not a cycle accurate model of any particular PIC microcomputer. It implements 
the 12-bit instruction set, the timer 0 module, the pre-scaler, and the watchdog 
timer.

As configured, the core supports single cycle (1) operation with internal 
block RAM serving as program memory. In addition to the block RAM program 
store, a 4x clock generator and reset controller is included as part of the in 
the demonstration. 

Three I/O ports are supported, but they are accessed as external registers and 
buffers using a bidirectional data bus. The TRIS I/O control registers are 
similarly supported. Thus, the core's user is able to map the TRIS and I/O 
port registers in a manner appropriate to the intended application.

Read-modify-operations on the I/O ports do not generate read strobes. Read 
strobes of the three I/O ports are generated only if the ports are being read 
using MOVF xxx,0 instructions. Similarly, the write enables for the three I/O 
ports are asserted whenever the ports are updated. This occurs during MOVWF 
instructions, or during read- modify-write operations such as XORF, MOVF, etc.

Status
------

Design and initial verification is complete. Verification using ISim, MPLAB, 
and a board with an XC3S200AN-4VQG100I FPGA, various oscillators, SEEPROMs, 
and RS-232/RS-485 transceivers is underway.

In circuit testing of the M16C5x soft-core microcomputer has demonstrated that 
the M16C5x can operate to **147.4560 MHz**. At this internal system clock 
frequency, a 10x multiplication of the external reference oscillator, the SPI 
shift clock divider must be set to divide the system clock by 4, which 
generates an SPI shift clock frequency of 36.864 MHz. Various combinations of 
the DCM multiplier have been generated at tested in the XC3S200A-4VQG100I 
FPGA. The following table shows the system clock frequencies tested, the SPI 
shift clock frequencies tested, and the maximum achievable standard UART bit 
rate:

    DCM Multiplier  System Clock (MHz)  SPI Clock (MHz) Max UART bit rate (MHz)
        4x               58.9824            29.4912         3.6864

        7x              103.2192            51.6096         0.9216
        7.5x            110.5920            55.2960         0.4608
        8x              117.9648            58.9824         7.3728
        8.5x            125.3376            62.6688         0.4608
        10x             147.4560            36.8640         1.8432

These results are only applicable to this particular configuration. The period 
constraint for the system clock is set for 12.5 ns, or 80 MHz. The 
relationship between the clock enable, 0.5 of the system clock, does not seem 
to be accomodated by the reported performance values. Further investigation is 
needed to establish if the results provided in the previous table should be 
accepted as the performance limits of the M16C5x core in this FPGA family.

A board has been configured with an XC3S50A-4VQG100I components, and it 
operates as expected at 80 MHz. A new internal resource configuration makes 
the UART clock, Clk_UART, a fixed output of the DCM. The UART clock is fixed 
at 2x ClkIn, or as is the case in this test configuration, 29.4912 MHz. 

Testing like that performed above with the XC3S200A-4VQG100I is shown below. 
It indicates that the upper operating frequency is limited to **140.0832 
MHz**. This upper limit is most likely imposed by the reduction in routing 
resources. The utilization factor in an XC3S50A-4VQG100I FPGA is **99%**, and _~50%_ 
in an XC3S200A-4VQG100I FPGA. The larger number of LUTs/Slices and routing 
resources allows Map and Place greater flexibility to satisfy the timing 
constraints.

Release Notes
-------------

###Release 1.0

In this release, the M16C5x has been synthesized, mapped, placed, routed, and 
used to configure an FPGA. The FPGA used for this initial test of the M16C5x 
was the XC3S200A-4VQG100I FPGA. The test program provided demonstrated that 
the M16C5x was executing the program in the same manner as simulated with the 
MPLAB simulator.

Using an external 14.7456 MHz oscillator, selected for use for use with the 
UART, square waves were generated by the core to illuminate external LEDs 
using the upper 6 bits of PortA. The square waves have the appropriate ratios, 
and the frequency of the fastest LED drive signal is ~4.753kHz.

The clock generator multiplies the input frequency to 58.9824 MHz which 
results in an effective instruction frequency of 29.4912 MHz because of the 
two cycle nature of the core. The instruction loop is essentially 8*(*+3*256), 
which equals 6208 cycles per LED toggle. The measured toggle frequency of the 
fastest LED is approximately equal to 29.4912 MHz / 6208, or 4.750 kHz.

Work will continue to verify the testbench results with the FPGA. The next 
release should include the UART, and test the ability of the core to 
send/receive data using the FIFOs at rates of 115,200 baud or greater.

###Release 2.0

In this release, the UART has been addded. An update has been made to the SPI 
I/F Master function; update correct fault with the framing of SPI Mode 3 
frames with shift lengths greater than 1 byte. A correction, not fully tested 
or verified, was made to the P16C5x core to correct anomalous behavior for 
BTFSC/BTFSS instructions.

UART integrated with the Release 1.0 core. Verification of the integrated 
interface is underway.

###Release 2.1

Testing with an M16C5x core processor program assembled using 
MPLAB and ISIM showed that polling of the UART status register to determine 
whether the transmit FIFO was empty or not (using the iTFE interrupt flag) 
would clear the generated interrupt flags before they had actually been 
captured and shifted in the SSP response to the core.

This indicated a clock domain crossing issue in the interrupt clearing logic. 
This release fixes that issue. Previous use of the UART does not poll the USR, 
so this problem does not manisfest itself in a reasonable amount of time, if 
ever. In other words, the synchronization fault has been present all along in 
the implementation, but the module's usage in the application (or testbench) 
did not present the conditions under which the fault manifests.

The correction required registering the USR data on the SSP clock domain, and 
qualifying the clearing of the interrupt flags on the basis of whether the 
flag is set in both domains when the USR is read. The addition of the register 
reduced the logic utilization, and only a small additonal time delay was 
incurred. The resulting design is still able to fit into a Spartan 3A XC3S50A-
4VQG100I FPGA.

Modified the UART Baud Rate Generator. Removed the fixed 16x12 ROM that 
provided the pre-scaler and divider constants for a fixed set of 16 baud 
rates. Added a 12-bit, write-only register, BRR - Baud Rate Register, that can 
be used to set the baud rate from 1/16 of the processor clock. With a 
58.9824 MHz oscillator, the baud rate can range from 3.6864Mbps down to 900 bps. 
Set the default baud rate to 9600 for a 58.9824 MHz UART clock.

Utilization for a XC3S50A-4VQG100I FPGA is 100%. The 128 byte LUT-based 
receive FIFO can be reduced to accomodate some additional functions. Synthesis 
and MAP/PAR able to implement the design. There is also some place holder 
logic that can be used for other purposes.

###Release 2.2

Updated the soft-core so as to be able to parameterize the microcontroller 
from the top module. Changed the frequency multiplication from 4 to 5 in order 
to test operation at the frequency which the UCF constrains Map/PAR tools. The 
input clock is driven by a 14.7456 MHz oscillator, and the clock multiplier 
(DCM) generates **73.7280 MHz**. The default baud rate, 9600, required that the 
default settings be adjusted. All other parameters remain the same.

Also added a Block RAM Memory Map file to the project. Utilized Xilinx's 
Data2MEM tool to insert modified program contents into the affected Block RAMs 
using MEM files dereived from standard MPLAB outputs. Tutorial on this subject 
is being prepared and will be released on an associated Wiki soon.

###Release 2.3

Updated the soft-core microcomputer. Fixed the UART clock, Clk_UART, to twice 
the input frequency. This means that the UART operates with a fixed reference 
frequency unlike Release 2.2 where Clk_UART was set to the system clock 
frequency.

Also added asynchronous resets to several registers in the UART so that it 
would simulate correcly with ISim. Direct control of the UART prescaler and 
divider was previously untested using the simulation. With that change to the 
baud rate generator made to UART, the reset/power-on values of these two logic 
functions are unknown. The unknowns, "X", propagate through the baud rate 
generator and prevent the simulator from resolving the state of the internal 
baud rate clock of the UART. Thus, although the rest of circuits simulate as 
expected, the transmit shift register never shifts because there's an 
"unknown" signal level applied on the bit clock.

###Release 2.4

Polling the UART's Receive Data Register (RDR) uncovered a race condition like 
that previously found and corrected in regards to polling the UART Status 
Register (USR). Correction required registering the RDR in the SCK clock 
domain, and qualifying the read enable pulse for the receive FIFO so that it 
is only generated if the Receive Rdy flag is present in the SCK clock domain. 
Otherwise, the Receive FIFO is not read which prevents the inadvertent 
clearing of the FIFO empty flag.

Test Program 4, M16C5x_Tst4.asm, is used to test the receive signal path. 
Hyperterminal and Tera Term were used to sent (without local echo) several 
large text files through the M16C5x UART. The test program polls the RDR, and 
if a character is received without error, then upper case are converted to 
lower case characters, and vice-versa. Using a Keyspan Quad Port USB serial 
port adapter, characters were sent to the M16C5x at a rate of 921.6k baud, the 
highest programmable baud rate supported by the Keyspan device. The echo back 
to terminal emulator appeared to be without error. (**Note:** _the two wire 
RS-232 mode of the UART was used for this test. The ADM3232 charge-pump RS-232 
transceiver appeared to work well at this frequency. Som slew rate limiting is 
visible on an O-scope, but it appears to be tolerable. These tests were 
conducted while the core was operating at **117.9648 MHz**._)

This release is expected to be the last public release of this soft-core 
microcomputer. The released core and peripherals are sufficient to demonstrate 
a non-trivial FPGA implementation of a soft-core microcomputer. Further 
developments will be focused on improving access to the internal block RAMs, 
and improving the I/O capabilities of the release core.

###Release 2.5

Converted the core to operate in a single cycle mode with the block RAM 
memories of the FPGA. Operating frequency, in a -4 Spartan 3A FPGA, is 60+ 
MHz. This rate is equivalent to the 117.9848 MHz reported above of for Release 
2.4. Some combinatorial path improvements were made to the processor core, 
P16C5x, by using wired-OR bus connections rather than explicit multiplexers. 
These improvements also provided some reductions in the resource utilization 
of the project.
